# competency-passbook

A competency passbook to collate, view, track and provide recognition against competencies achieved against learnings completed by each official on the iGoT Karmayogi platform. A Competency Passbook (CP) should be a algorithm-based aggregate which lists the competencies needed by the user as per their role. It also lists the gaps in competencies. The userâ€™s main objective is therefore the closure of the gaps through the selection and consumption of the Courses. This should handle both online and offline based learning.
